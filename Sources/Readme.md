## About the `Sources` Directory

The [`/Sources`](./Sources) directory contains **third-party assets** — such as fonts, images, icons, symbols, and other media — that are **not part of the project’s own source code**.  
They are included **only** for demonstration purposes and to ensure that the template works out-of-the-box.

**Important:**  
- These assets **are not** covered by this project's license.  
- Fonts, images, icons, and any other non-source-code materials are each subject to **their own licenses**, which may differ from the main project license.  
- You **must** review and comply with the license terms for each of these materials **before** using, modifying, or distributing them.

**Recommendation:**  
If you plan to publish or distribute your work:  
1. Replace these assets with your own properly licensed materials.  
2. Include the correct attribution and license files for any third-party assets you decide to keep.

**TL;DR:** Fonts, images, icons, and any other non-code assets in `/Sources` are **third-party** and **not licensed under this project**.
