this is context base project
we describe some essential hint's in this file for more clarification.

we added .gitignore file inside Template folder for ignoring tracking irrevelant file's 
but we don't initialize git inside that folder because it's not necessary and you can do it simply with git init command.

so let's start it

preface: what is goal of our project structure:

out project base has consisted from 4 main folder
1. Setups:
you put in this folder good things!

2. Sections:

3. Sources:

4. Symbols:
in this minmal example we used one custom emoji in our text by putting it's pdf file (footnote: it currently has better supporting for vector than svg, also you can use png without problem) in this folder.


section:
what is purpose of RاااEADME.md?
1. for emacs session sav/load
2. it act's as start menu for end user
you should provide simple instruction for how to compile the project and what is your context version
in this manner it make's your project more portable.
