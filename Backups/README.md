# Backups Directory

This `Backups` folder is **excluded** from the `context-lmtx` processing pipeline.  
Files placed here are **not** indexed, scanned, or processed by the system.  

## Purpose
The primary goal of this folder is to provide you with a safe space within the project where you can store:

- Backup copies of your work  
- Temporary files  
- Drafts or alternative versions  
- Any additional resources you don't want to interfere with the main project content  

## Advantages
- **No interference**: Files here will never conflict with or overwrite existing project files in other directories.
- **Safe storage**: You can safely store any type of file — text, images, archives, datasets, etc.
- **Organized backups**: Keeps all backup and temporary data in one dedicated place.

## Usage
Simply place your files inside this folder:
```plaintext
project-root/
├── Backups/  ← Safe for backups; ignored by context-lmtx
├── Sections/
├── Setups/
└── ...

The `Backups` folder is **not** tracked by `context-lmtx`, so you can store anything here without affecting the build process or processed content.

**Tip:**  
For version control (e.g., Git), if you don't want to commit your backups to the repository, consider adding this folder to your `.gitignore` file:

gitignore
Backups/
